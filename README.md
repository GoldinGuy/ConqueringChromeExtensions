This lab was created because @benthaw and I knew a company willing to pay $70 for a simple chrome extension that could refresh a webpage at a set interval. After attending this workshop, you can make that!

This lab sample extension is based on @SocialWorker's awesome [AutoReloadPage](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/auto-reload-page/cggooibcfafefodnecpcbgiebbjjpnpb/related)
